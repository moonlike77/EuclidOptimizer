# Euclid Optimizer
Genetic Algorithm for Vector Optimization: Python implementation of a GA to find a 3-dimensional vector minimizing total Euclidean distance to given points. Uses binary encoding, roulette-wheel selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions and track the best result across iterations.
